<p>
I had to spend one day to find out how to test localhost having subdomain when I use Rubymine IDE.
Rubymine is great tool but there is no way to setup subdomain in <b>Run</b> configuration.
</p>

<p>
So I had to change my MBP's hosts file; <code>/etc/hosts</code>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>myadbox.dev</b> is test domain and <b>audi</b> is subdomain
</li>
</ul>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">127.0.0.1	localhost
127.0.0.1 audi.myadbox.dev
</pre>
</div>
