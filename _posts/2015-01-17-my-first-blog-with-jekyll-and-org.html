I have found that github provides free static website hosting service which url is <b>yourid</b>.github.io in general.
And I have been into Emacs and Org mode so I wanted to use emacs as my blogging tool.

Today I have been trying to setup my emacs for blogging tool and found this <a href="http://cute-jumper.github.io/emacs/2013/10/06/orgmode-to-github-pages-with-jekyll/">Great Guideline</a>.
</p>

<p>
And setup everything quite easily :)
